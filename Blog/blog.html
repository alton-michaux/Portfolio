            Here I am, 34 years old at a job that was supposed to be temporary 12
            years ago. 
          <br><br>
            I've always had a goal of escaping at some point, but
            it was always easy to dash those dreams with a family to feed. In a lot of ways this factory has been my security blanket making it easier to ignore my own potential and settle for an existence that required less effort.
          <br><br>
            However, with the recent pandemic and the state of things not looking so
            good at work, I knew now was time to make a change.
          <br><br>
            I first learned about "Code the Dream" through a text from my mother. She's always sending me
            opportunities she thinks I'd be interested in, but something grabbed me instantly when I read her text with a link to a program called "Code the Dream".
          <br><br>
            After the initial application and a few hours of pre-work I realized how <em>valuable</em> a skillset
            this is and that it's something that I <em>need</em> to learn.
          <br><br>
            I know this might not seem like a big deal, but I've spent the last
            <strong>12 years</strong> delusional and wasting time with things I <em>knew</em>
            were never going to take to me to any legitimate career, at least not from the role that I'm currently playing in the life of my family.
          <br><br>
            It feels really good to
            <strong>finally have direction!</strong>

            Coding isn't my first rodeo as far as learning new things: I've recently spent a few months learning to trade stocks and other financial markets and this summer I basically tore my lawnmower apart and put it back together with the help of some YouTube videos. Something felt different about coding tho, I've been modestly "successful" in my little learning adventures, but I <em>constantly</em> crave coding knowledge. 
          <br><br>
            I had actually begun to put together a couple of "5-year plans" that would actually give me a legitimate chance of achieving my goals, but they were all vastly dependent on me alone. This isn't to say that I see that as a bad thing or that coding will be any different, it would just be really valuable to have mentors break this stuff down and get you to a point to where people are going to <em>want</em> to hire you based on your <em>actual, provable</em> skills as opposed to what college you graduated from or if you even went to college at all. 
          <br><br>
            Well, that's where I just want to thank
            <strong><a href="https://www.khanacademy.org/">Khan Academy</a></strong>
            for providing this awesome <strong>free</strong> platform to keep
            learning and furthering myself every single day. 
          <br><br>
            Even if I'm not accepted to <strong>CTD</strong> in a couple of weeks, I fully intend to learn and become
            proficient in multiple coding languages within a year.
          <br><br>
            The end goal is a job in web devolopment or software engineering.

            After 17 days of anxious energy and bi-polar mood swings, I <em>finally</em> got
            my acceptance email! <b>This is a huge deal guys! </b> (for me at least)
          <br><img class="samurai2" src="https://pa1.narvii.com/6031/ab546c91a30a6f829961e3427dba501314e2fd5a_hq.gif" alt="Afro Samurai: My Thoughts | Anime Amino">
            I can finally move forward with a <b>solid plan</b> knowing that I'll be taking this path for
            the next 6 months (and beyond). 
          <br><br>
            My plan is to be out of my current job situation and in the tech field within <b>one year.</b>
          <br><br>
            <strong>Let's do this.</strong>

          Hey guys! Sorry, I know it's been a few weeks since I've posted but I've been super busy with CTD coursework.<br>
          Things are getting crazy at work and I get more than enough motivation from that place to code than I'll ever need. 
          <br><b>I CAN NOT get out fast enough.</b><br>
          Just going to keep up the hard work and keep my head down for a few months.<br>
          About to start Javascript loops!
        <br><strong>Still going strong.</strong>
